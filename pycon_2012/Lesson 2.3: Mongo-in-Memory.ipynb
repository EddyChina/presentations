      " - unit tests run quickly", 
      " - unit tests are *independent* of one another ",

      "Unfortunately, these two characteristics are at odds with one another when ", 
      "testing MongoDB applications. MongoDB excels at rapidly reading and writing ", 
      "data to established databases. In order to make sure these operations stay ", 
      "fast, MongoDB allocates large contiguous data files on the disk. By default, ", 
      "even an *empty* database takes up 200MB on disk. While this is fine when you", 
      "have large, long-lived databases, it becomes problematic in the case of unit ", 
      "tests.", 
      "", 
      "## MIM to the (unit testing) Rescue", 
      "", 
      "Since MongoDB manages everything at the database level, the most effective way", 
      "of isolating your unit tests from one another is to make sure it's been dropped", 
      "before your unit test begins, allowing MongoDB to create it as-needed, and then", 
      "to drop it again at the end."
